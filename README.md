# Product/Image Similarity


### TODO:
- [ ] Use locality sensitive hashing/k-nearest neighbors to find similar products quickly.
  - [ ] Replace generating dataframe of cosine similarities. We only need a single pass through dataset to obtain and store embedding vectors.
- [ ] Optimize/speed up image pre-processing step.
